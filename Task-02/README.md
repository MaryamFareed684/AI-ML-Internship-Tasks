○ Task-2 objective 
 Use historical stock data to predict the next day's closing price. 
 
○ Dataset used 
 Stock market data from Yahoo Finance (retrieved using the yfinance Python library) 
 
○ Models applied 
In my task-2 I used Linear Regression model to predict closing price of next day
Linear Regression is a method used to predict a continuous value (number) by finding a linear relationship between:

Input variables (X) → features

Output variable (y) → target
 
○ Key results and findings 
The model was trained using Linear regression to predict next day closing price
We use High, open ,low and volume as input feature
The targrt feature is closing price of next day 
The final r2 ,mse and mae score indicating that a significant portion of the variation in stock prices is explained by the selected features and prediction errors are relatively small compared to the overall price range.
Prediction accuracy:
The actual vs predicted close price plot shows that predicted and actual price are closely related with minor deviations.
